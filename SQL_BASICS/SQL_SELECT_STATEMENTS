SQL SELECT STATEMENT SYNTAX
===========================

SELECT 
    column_1, column_2, ...
FROM
    table_1
[INNER | LEFT |RIGHT] JOIN table_2 ON conditions
WHERE
    conditions
GROUP BY column_1
HAVING group_conditions
ORDER BY column_1
LIMIT offset, length;

The SELECT statement consists of several clauses as explained in the following list:

SELECT   followed by a list of comma-separated columns or an asterisk (*) to indicate that you want to return all columns.
FROM     specifies the table or view where you want to query the data.
JOIN     gets related data from other tables based on specific join conditions.
WHERE    clause filters row in the result set.
GROUP    BY clause groups a set of rows into groups and applies aggregate functions on each group.
HAVING   clause filters group based on groups defined by GROUP BY clause.
ORDER BY clause specifies a list of columns for sorting.
LIMIT    constrains the number of returned rows.



===================== SELECT DISTINCT SYNTAX ==========================
SELECT DISTINCT
    columns
FROM
    table_name
WHERE
    where_conditions;

Example:
========
To remove the duplicate last names, you add the DISTINCT clause to the SELECT statement as follows:

SELECT DISTINCT
    lastname
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY lastname;


You can use the DISTINCT clause with more than one column. In this case, MySQL uses the combination of values in 
these columns to determine the uniqueness of the row in the result set.

Example:
========
SELECT DISTINCT
    state, city
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    state IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY state , city;


If you use the GROUP BY clause in the SELECT statement without using aggregate functions, the GROUP BY clause 
behaves like the DISTINCT clause.

The following statement uses the GROUP BY clause to select the unique states of customers from the customers table.

SELECT                                                      SELECT DISTINCT
    state                                                       state
FROM                           This is Similar to:          FROM
    customers                                                   customers;
GROUP BY state;


Generally speaking, the DISTINCT clause is a special case of the GROUP BY clause. The difference between DISTINCT clause
and GROUP BY clause is that the GROUP BY clause sorts the result set whereas the DISTINCT clause does not.

If you add the ORDER BY clause to the statement that uses the  DISTINCT clause, the result set is sorted and it is the
same as the one returned by the statement that uses GROUP BY clause.


'''MySQL DISTINCT and aggregate functions:'''
You can use the DISTINCT clause with an aggregate function e.g., SUM, AVG, and COUNT, to remove duplicate rows before the aggregate functions are applied to the result set.

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT state)
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    country = 'USA';
